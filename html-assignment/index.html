      <p>I am an international student from Romania. I was born on 8<sup>th</sup> of January, 1993. Before starting this program I worked as a <i>Software Quality Assurance Tester</i>, my last workplace being <b>Pentalog Romania</b>. Being curious by nature I always wanted to know more about processes and the whole <abbr title="Software Development Life Cycle">SDLC</abbr> and this is one of the reasons I am taking this program. </p>

      <p>I am also a self taught photographer. Back in my home country I used to photograph at different concerts.<em>I was even featured on the official page of the band The World Alive with a photo of their front man!</em> That was the best feeling in the world as I was and I'm still an amateur photographer.</p>
      <p>I enjoy spending my time doing the follwing activities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading books</li>
        <li>Watching movies &amp; TV Shows</li>
        <li>Playing guitar &amp; bass</li>
        <li>Playing video games</li>
      </ul>

        <p>"Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper. Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They’re huge and abstract. And they’re very beautiful."</p><cite>- David Lynch</cite>

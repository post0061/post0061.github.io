            <p>The first bass guitar was created in the early 1930s by Paul Tutmarc. He based his design off of the Hawaiian steel guitar, which was popular at the time. The bass guitar has come a long way since then, with many different variations and styles being created. The instrument has been used in a wide variety of genres, including rock, jazz, blues, and even country. The bass guitar is an essential part of any band, and has been for over 80 years.</p>
            <p>The first Jazz Bass was released in 1960. Jet Harris (The Shadows), James Jamerson (Motown), and Rocco Prestia were among its most popular stars. During the 1960s, there was a noticeable shift in rock. Pink Floyd, Pink Floyd, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, The Animals, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, The Who, and The Doors are just a few of the artists who have recorded. In the 1960s, several manufacturers began to make versions, including Gibson, Hfner, Rickenbacker, and Fender. Double basses are gradually being phased out and replaced by bass guitars tuned in fourths (E, A, D, and G). The bass guitar has been around for nearly a century, and it comes in a variety of shapes and sizes.</p>
